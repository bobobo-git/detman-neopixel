# clock.py
This is a simple clock app running aon a AdaFruit LED Ring (12 LEDS), driven by raspberry/raspbian

This is a quick demonstration of the 12 Neopixel ring of adafruit.
I've written it to become familiar with the properties of the multicolor LEDs.

Seconds, minutes and hours are represented by colors.
  * hours: cooresonding led is blue
  * minutes: all leds up to current minute led is shown white, increasing intensity
  * seconds: corresponding led ist shown red; additional, every second a red led runs around the circle

With my wiring, the green and red colors are switched (Don't know how to fix it).
